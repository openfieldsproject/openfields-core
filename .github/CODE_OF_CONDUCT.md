# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of **The Open Fields Project** pledge to make participation in our community a safe, inclusive, and welcoming experience for everyone — regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or geographic location.

We are especially mindful of the communities we aim to support — often underserved, rural, and resource-constrained — and commit to upholding their dignity, voice, and cultural realities in all of our work.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences
- Being open to constructive feedback
- Offering help to others — especially newcomers
- Recognizing and valuing non-technical contributions

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Discriminatory jokes or comments
- Harassment or threats (public or private)
- Dismissive or elitist attitudes toward non-technical participants
- Inappropriate sexual language or imagery
- Sustained disruption of conversations or spaces

## Our Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces — GitHub repositories, discussions, issue trackers, and any external forums under The Open Fields Project's umbrella. It also applies when representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement
