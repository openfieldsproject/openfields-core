## Credits & Acknowledgements

This project would not be possible without the collective work of the open-source and scientific communities. We gratefully acknowledge:

- The developers and maintainers of the open-source libraries, frameworks, and tools that power our platform.
- Researchers and institutions who have made public data available for the betterment of all.
- Community members who share knowledge, time, and experience in building solutions that work for their realities.
- Those whose work we build on, directly or indirectly — whether recognized by name or not.

If you see something we’ve overlooked, please let us know so we can give proper credit.

This is, and always will be, a project by the many — not the few.
